Title: Minimalist Banking System with Cryptocurrency Integration

Description:

Welcome to the Minimalist Banking System with Cryptocurrency Integration project on GitHub! This open-source project is a demonstration of a simple yet functional banking system that operates entirely within the command line, with no database, and integrates cryptocurrency transactions.

Key Features:
1. **User-Friendly Command Line Interface:** Our banking system offers a user-friendly command line interface (CLI) for easy navigation and interaction.

3. **Balance Management:** Perform basic banking operations such as checking balances, making deposits, and processing withdrawals.

4. **Transaction History:** Keep track of your account's transaction history to monitor financial activities.

5. **Cryptocurrency Integration:** Our system integrates cryptocurrency transactions to provide users with a taste of the crypto world. You can create and manage cryptocurrency wallets, send and receive crypto, and view your crypto wallet balance.

6. **Security:** Although this project is intended for educational purposes and not for production use, it includes basic security measures to protect users' data during their session.

7. **No Database Dependency:** Unlike traditional banking systems, this project doesn't rely on a database for data storage, ensuring simplicity and portability.

8. **Open-Source:** This project is entirely open-source, meaning you can study and modify the code to understand how it works or even expand its functionality.

Usage:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the CLI application.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to create and manage accounts, perform banking transactions, and explore cryptocurrency integration.

Please note that this project is intended for educational purposes and serves as a minimalistic example of a banking system with cryptocurrency integration. It is not intended for actual financial use, and no real funds or cryptocurrencies are involved.
